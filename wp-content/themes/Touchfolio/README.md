Touchfolio Free Responsive WordPress Theme
==========================================

### <http://dimsemenov.com/themes/touchfolio/>

*Touchfolio* is simple theme created with focus on content and providing great user experience on majority of desktop and mobile devices.
Theme is currently in beta, please [leave feedback, report bugs and vote for ideas](http://support.dimsemenov.com/forums/159023-touchfolio).

Theme is partly "sponsored" by new version of my [RoyalSlider](http://dimsemenov.com/plugins/royal-slider/) plugin.

**General Features**

* Responsive layout down to mobile.
* Skinning system based on LESS CSS (similar to variables in Twitter Bootstrap). Controls photoshop file included.
* Two types of portfolio - [gallery with list in menu](http://dimsemenov.com/themes/touchfolio/demo/) and [masonry gallery](http://dimsemenov.com/themes/touchfolio/demo/alternative-portfolio/).
*Multiple gallery pages allowed, grouped by category. For example, you can add to menu two pages — "Web" and "Print" with custom list of projects in each.

**Gallery**

* Super fast native-style touch navigation for supported devices. Swipe left and right to view project images. Swipe up and down to browse projects (powered by [RoyalSlider](http://dimsemenov.com/plugins/royal-slider/) engine).
Alternatively, use keyboard or mouse wheel on desktop.
* YouTube and Vimeo video support.
* Three types of image scale types — fit to screen if image is larger, fill the screen and no scale (may be different for each album).
* Custom album background color or pattern (may be different for each album).
* Automatically preloads nearby images after current is loaded.
* Unlimited number of galleries and photos per album, within reason, of course.
* Simple and fast gallery management — upload, reorder, remove images.
* SEO optimized, images are indexed by search engines

**Blog & Pages**

* Nothing spec    ial, all default elements, like headings, blockquotes, lists, images, captions are styled.
* Threaded comments support, HTML5 inputs in reply form.

**Advanced (mostly for devs)**

* Browser support: modern browsers, IE7+. Mobile: iOS, Android 2.2+, Opera Mobile (haven't tested in all versions), Windows Phone 7+, Blackberry OS and even black and white Kindle Keyboard.
* Hardware-accelerated CSS3 transitions with fallback (supports Firefox 10+ 3d transform). Auto disables on Google Chrome, because of stupid font-rendering.
* Does not block zoom gesture on mobile devices.
* Built with LESS CSS, processed and cached by wp-less.
* Gallery API - documented public methods, callbacks, properties. Gallery can be resized and placed anywhere you want.
* Gallery keeps only 5 images in browser at once time to save memory on weak mobile devices.
* CSS files are merged, all controls are loaded using one sprite to minify http requests.
* Works great with WP super cache.
* Fully translatable and localizable, .po file included.

**License**

There are simple rules:

* You can NOT redistribute Touchfolio theme or parts from it anywhere else.
* You can NOT use javascript gallery from this theme in another project, it can be used only with Touchfolio theme.
